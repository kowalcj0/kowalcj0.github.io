Why do people use URL shorteners?

They're simply unreliable and bad for privacy.

I've already encountered quite a few dead short URLs because the URL shortener 
service was closed down and it was rather painfull waste of time to find 
the original link.

They're bad for privacy because the shortener service knows what are you browsing.

Why would give away such important meta data about your readers to someone else?

Aren't regular stats enough for marketing people?
