Best practises for writing test scenarios:

- capture the essence (outcome) of the scenario in its title
- write scenarios in a [declarative style](https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2013/apr/10/cukeup-2013-conference-digest-gherkin-bdd)
    - please watch this
        [presentation](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/3141-user-centred-scenarios-describing-capabilities-not-solutions)
- include actors in your scenarios from day one
- avoid conditional logic (e.g.: `But` steps or steps that negate the previous
    ones)


Implementation best practices:

- make your step definitions one-liners
- parametrize you steps
- avoid:
    - code duplication
    - conditional logic
        - as it's generally hard to understand
- use [Page Object pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html)
- don't include any test logic in the Page Objects


Maintainability best practices:

- flaky tests
    - Avoid -> Control -> Isolate
