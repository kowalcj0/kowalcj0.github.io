### My few cents

What I like about this movie:

* how barren lands of Manchuria turned into somehow beautiful landscapes
* is that the director with his camera managed not to be an obstrustive and unwanted actor
* inner strugle of the main character
* emotions

It's great movie and in my opinion it deserves 9 out of 10 points.

### Favourite scenes

My three favourite scenes are towards the end of the movie:

* the one with the snow

* when Kaji's wife Michiko, prevent him from releasing the prisoners
* the one with prisoners execution and an epic intro when Kaji stands by a hastily made grave
