I finally started recording videos explaining how to use [Gee](https://github.com/kowalcj0/gee).  
Gee is a tool based on a [JMeter-EC2](https://github.com/oliverlloyd/jmeter-ec2) project by Oliver Lloyd.  
It allows you to run JMeter tests on: 

* Amazon EC2
* Vagrant boxes
* Linux hosts

Running your tests using this tool is better than using the standard distributed mode in Jmeter, 
because it doesn't require constant communication between the master node and slave nodes. 

Here are first few videos explaining how to clone the project, spawn new vagrant box and finally how to run an example project on that virtual box. 

Hope you all will find in useful :) 

1. clone the project 
    {{< yt id="RWkJl4OXTJI" >}}
2. initialize vagrant box 
    {{< yt id="cUcGvLy_Lf8" >}}
3. run an example test on a vagrant box 
    {{< yt id="WrEqdKgz26Y" >}}
