      <description>A bunch of my favourite quotes, mottos &amp;amp; adages I&amp;rsquo;ve accrued over time.
In English  I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened. &amp;ndash; Mark Twain ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª There are three sides to every story: yours, mine, and the truth and no one is lying. &amp;ndash; Anonymous ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª Change is the only constant. &amp;ndash; Unknown Change begets change as much as repetition reinforces repetition. &amp;ndash; Bill Drayton The shortest path to oneself leads around the world.</description>

      <description>A while ago I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered Wallabag  . It&amp;rsquo;s a self hostable application for saving web pages. It extracts the article&amp;rsquo;s content and can automatically tag it with matching label. Basically it&amp;rsquo;s an open-source competitor of Pocket  , Instapaper  or Evernote  .
Fetching a list of all entries via Wallabag&amp;amp;rsquo;s API  is very easy. And with a help of jq  you can transform it into a simple JSON file which you can use to populate a Hugo Data Templates  .</description>
