      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much problems with getting the Brightness Control to work in Mint 16, but after installing v17 I had to struggle much more.
I honestly admit that I don&amp;rsquo;t know which of the following steps actually did the trick, nevertheless it works now :)
OK, I&amp;rsquo;m currently running Mint 17 x64 on Lenovo W530 with Nvidia Quadro K1000M and with Nvidia 331.38 installed. Display mode in BIOS is set to Discrete Mode.</description>

      <description>Recently I had to update the bios of my laptop from a USB pendrive, because I had no CD/DVD drive around. Cameron Seader&amp;rsquo;s post Lenovo BIOS Update method for Linux and USB thumb drive came very handy, but used an obsolete tool so I updated his instructions a bit to make them work.
1. Get the machine type and model of your laptop In order to grab this information you can either go to the BIOS or use dmidecode or hwinfo.</description>
