 IMDb 8.6 / 10 Rotten Tomatoes 89% - avg. rating 7.7 / 10 Wikipedia  Plot  A Japanese pacifist, unable to face the dire consequences of conscientious objection, is transformed by his attempts to compromise with the demands of war-time Japan. 1
 My few cents What I like about this movie:
 how barren lands of Manchuria turned into somehow beautiful landscapes is that the director with his camera managed not to be an obstrustive and unwanted actor inner strugle of the main character emotions  It&amp;rsquo;s great movie and in my opinion it deserves 9 out of 10 points.</description>
