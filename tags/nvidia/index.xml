      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t had much problems with getting the Brightness Control to work in Mint 16, but after installing v17 I had to struggle much more.
I honestly admit that I don&amp;rsquo;t know which of the following steps actually did the trick, nevertheless it works now :)
OK, I&amp;rsquo;m currently running Mint 17 x64 on Lenovo W530 with Nvidia Quadro K1000M and with Nvidia 331.38 installed. Display mode in BIOS is set to Discrete Mode.</description>
